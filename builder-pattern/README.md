# Builder Pattern Recipe

The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Intent

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

## Structure (MermaidJS)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Director {
        - builder: Builder
        + setBuilder(builder: Builder)
        + constructComplexObject()
        + constructAnotherObject()
    }
    class Builder {
        <<Interface>>
        + buildPartA()
        + buildPartB()
        + buildPartC()
        + getResult() : Product
    }
    class ConcreteBuilder {
        - product: Product
        + buildPartA()
        + buildPartB()
        + buildPartC()
        + getResult() : Product
    }
    class Product {
        - parts: List<String>
        + addPart(part: String)
        + show()
    }
    class Client {
        + operation()
    }

    Director --> Builder : uses
    ConcreteBuilder ..|> Builder : implements
    ConcreteBuilder --> Product : creates/builds
    Client --> Director : uses
    Client ..> ConcreteBuilder : creates
    Client ..> Product : uses result
```

## Explanation

*   **Builder**: Specifies an abstract interface for creating parts of a `Product` object.
*   **ConcreteBuilder**: Constructs and assembles parts of the product by implementing the `Builder` interface. It defines and keeps track of the representation it creates and provides an interface for retrieving the product (`getResult`).
*   **Product**: Represents the complex object under construction. `ConcreteBuilder` builds the product's internal representation and defines the process by which it's assembled. Includes classes that define the constituent parts, including interfaces for assembling the parts into the final result.
*   **Director**: Constructs an object using the `Builder` interface. The `Director` is not responsible for creating the parts, but for orchestrating the construction process using a specific sequence of calls to the `Builder`.
*   **Client**: Creates a `ConcreteBuilder` object and passes it to the `Director`. Can also retrieve the final `Product` from the `Builder`.

This pattern is particularly useful when an object needs to be created with many configuration options or parts. It encapsulates the way a complex object is constructed, allowing the construction process to be varied independently. It improves readability and maintainability by isolating complex construction logic.
