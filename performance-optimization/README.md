# Java Performance Optimization Recipe

Optimizing Java application performance involves understanding how the JVM works, identifying bottlenecks, and applying appropriate techniques at different levels (code, JVM, system).

## Key Areas for Optimization

*   **Algorithm and Data Structure Choice**: The most significant impact often comes from choosing efficient algorithms (e.g., O(log n) vs. O(n^2)) and appropriate data structures for the task (e.g., `HashMap` for fast lookups, `ArrayList` vs. `LinkedList` depending on access patterns).
*   **Code Level Optimizations**:
    *   **Minimize Object Creation**: Excessive object creation puts pressure on the Garbage Collector (GC). Reuse objects where possible (e.g., using object pools, `StringBuilder` for string concatenation in loops).
    *   **Efficient I/O**: Use buffering (`BufferedInputStream`, `BufferedWriter`) for file/network I/O. Consider non-blocking I/O (NIO, frameworks like Netty, Vert.x) or virtual threads for I/O-bound applications.
    *   **String Operations**: Be mindful of string concatenation in loops (prefer `StringBuilder`).
    *   **Primitive Types**: Use primitive types (`int`, `long`, `double`) instead of wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Long`, `Double`) where possible to avoid boxing/unboxing overhead, especially in performance-critical sections or large collections.
    *   **Stream API**: While expressive, be aware of potential overhead from boxing/unboxing or intermediate operations. Parallel streams can help for CPU-bound tasks on suitable data but have coordination overhead.
    *   **Concurrency**: Efficiently use `java.util.concurrent` utilities, avoid excessive locking contention, consider lock-free algorithms or atomic variables. Virtual threads can improve scalability for blocking I/O.
*   **JVM Tuning**:
    *   **Heap Size (`-Xms`, `-Xmx`)**: Setting appropriate initial and maximum heap sizes is crucial. Too small leads to frequent GC; too large can cause long GC pauses.
    *   **Garbage Collector Selection & Tuning**: Modern JVMs offer various GC algorithms (e.g., G1GC, ZGC, Shenandoah) optimized for different goals (throughput vs. low latency). Tuning GC parameters (e.g., region sizes, pause time goals) can significantly impact performance.
    *   **JIT Compiler**: Understand how the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler optimizes bytecode to native code (e.g., method inlining, loop unrolling). JVM warmup is needed for JIT to reach peak performance.
*   **System Level**: OS tuning, network configuration, database optimization.

## Identifying Bottlenecks (Profiling)

Optimization should *always* start with measurement. Profiling tools help identify where the application spends most of its time or allocates most memory.

*   **CPU Profiling**: Identifies hot methods where execution time is concentrated.
    *   **Sampling**: Periodically takes thread stack traces. Lower overhead, good for overall picture.
    *   **Instrumentation**: Modifies bytecode to record method entry/exit. Higher overhead, more precise timings.
*   **Memory Profiling**: Analyzes heap usage, identifies memory leaks, tracks object allocation sites.
*   **Tools**:
    *   **JProfiler**, **YourKit**: Powerful commercial profilers.
    *   **VisualVM**: Free tool included with JDK (or available separately), provides CPU/memory sampling, heap dumps, thread analysis.
    *   **Java Flight Recorder (JFR) & JDK Mission Control (JMC)**: Low-overhead profiling built into the JDK. JFR collects data, JMC analyzes it.
    *   **Async-profiler**: Low-overhead sampling profiler producing flame graphs.

## Benchmarking

For micro-optimizations or comparing specific code alternatives, use a proper benchmarking harness.

*   **JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness)**: The standard tool for writing reliable Java benchmarks. Handles JVM warmup, dead code elimination, loop optimizations, and other pitfalls that make simple `System.nanoTime()` measurements unreliable.

## General Principles

*   **Measure First**: Don't optimize prematurely based on guesses. Profile!
*   **Focus on Hotspots**: Concentrate efforts on the parts of the code where the most time is spent.
*   **Understand Trade-offs**: Optimization often involves trade-offs (e.g., memory usage vs. CPU time, readability vs. performance).
*   **Keep it Simple**: Complex optimizations can be hard to maintain and may not yield significant benefits.

Performance tuning is an iterative process of measuring, identifying bottlenecks, applying changes, and measuring again.
